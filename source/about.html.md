This Congressional Bill Outcome Predictor was originally a project for Stanford's CS 221 class entitled "Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques" taught by [Percy Lang](http://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/). You can find the project code and pointers to the data [on Github](https://github.com/devonzuegel/cs221-project/). Our group included [Arushi Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arushijain), [Emma Marriott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emarriott), and [Devon Zuegel](http://devonzuegel.com).

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions or comments about the project.
